# Spacecraft
A sample data set D is provided online in the file Spacecraft.mat. Use the load command to load this data into your workspace. A matrix D contains data on several experimental spacecraft engines. The matrix is organized in pairs of rows. Each pair of rows contains data measured during tests of the engines. For each pair of rows, the odd numbered row contains several measurements of the total energy used by the engine and the even numbered row contains the corresponding total kinetic energy imparted to the spacecraft. Recalling the equation for energy efficiency, E0=Î·EI we see that the efficiency of the engine is the slope of the line if the kinetic energy of the spacecraft (the output energy, E0) is plotted versus energy input to the engine EI
